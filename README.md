This project was created as my final project for stream 1 of the Code Institute course. It is a simple portfolio website, built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with some Bootstrap, in the code editor Sublime Text.

I began by creating an index.html page, with links to my projects.html and contact.html pages. The index.html page opens with a 3 second loading image, created using CSS and JavaScript logic from a superhi tutorial (https://www.superhi.com/). There are links on all of the pages to my own github, gmail and instagram pages. The project page links to the other two projects I created during this course, for stream 2 and 3. The contact page allows users to submit a form with queries. I used my own images in the pages. The project was tested in a number of different browsers, and deployed using GitHub pages.
