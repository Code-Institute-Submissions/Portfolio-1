	<p>My name is Katie. I am an aspiring web designer and this is my first portfolio. I don't have any projects to my name just yet but I intend to change that as soon as possible! I currently call Dublin, Ireland, home, and am in the middle of completing an online coding course with the Code Institute. Please get in touch with any questions!</p>
